_ABSTRACT:_ Six near-death experiences (NDEs) and three reincarnation-intermission experiences (IEs) recorded between the 1880s and the 1950s among
the Tlingit Indians of the southeastern Alaskan panhandle are compared to
NDEs and IEs reported from other Amerindian peoples and are shown to have
many features in common with them. Tlingit and other Amerindian NDEs are
also similar to NDEs from small-scale societies elsewhere in the world. NDEs
and IEs share structural similarities and feature human and nonhuman spirits
in similar roles. Perceptions of the material world are reported during all stages
of both NDEs and IEs. These congruencies support the notion that consciousness
separates from the body during NDEs. The implications of this conclusion for
understanding the nature of discarnate states of consciousness are explored, and
a model of survival that explains consistencies as well as individual and cultural
variations in NDEs and IEs is proposed.

indian NDEs in relation to revitalization movements. Juan Gómez-Jeria (1993) reported an NDE from the Mapuche of Chile. Dorothy
Ayers Counts (1983), Green (1984), Allan Kellehear (2001, 2008), and
James McClenon (2006a) described NDEs from small-scale indigenous societies elsewhere in the world.
The 50 or so NDEs assembled by these authors constitute an important subset of non-Western NDEs, which differ from Western NDEs in
the rarity of light and tunnel sensations and life reviews (Kellehear,
2008, 2009; Ohkado & Greyson, 2014). NDEs from small-scale indigenous societies, many of which have tribal social organizations and a
hunter-gatherer subsistence base, may be contrasted with those from
complex state-level societies such as India, Thailand, China, and Japan (Becker, 1981; Murphy, 2001; Ohkado & Greyson, 2014; Pasricha
& Stevenson, 1986). The former reveal the impacts of an animistic
worldview rather than Hinduism or Buddhism, although the more acculturated sometimes have overlays from world religions, especially
Christianity—​ ­as, for example, when spirit entities are identified as
Jesus rather than a native cultural figure.
In this paper, I present six NDEs recorded between the 1880s and
the 1950s among the Tlingit Indians of the southeastern Alaskan
panhandle. NDEs reported before Moody (1975) drew attention to the
phenomenon are valuable because they are free from bias that might
come from an awareness of the patterns he delineated. However, seldom are they directly comparable to contemporary cases. Only a few
are based on interviews with the experiencers or are related by the experiencers themselves. Some derive from second-hand contemporary
accounts, and others are culled from previously published sources that
may be quite old.
The six NDEs included here were first reported by American anthropologists Franz Boas, Frances Knapp, John Swanton, and Frederica de Laguna, who were interested in them for the insights into
cultural traditions they provided and who were not concerned with
the question of their relation to experience. Several of the accounts are
said to have occurred in earlier generations. These stories doubtless
had been retold many times before being written down by the ethnographers and could have influenced each other. At least one has a variant. Nevertheless, the similarity of these accounts to NDE accounts
from other small-scale societies is not a trivial matter, and they may
well be grounded in events that occurred more or less as narrated. I
will follow established practice and treat these historical accounts as
NDEs, with the understanding that their exact relation to experience
is uncertain.

In addition to the six NDEs, I introduce three Tlingit intermission
experiences (IEs), that is, memories of the interval between death and
rebirth in reincarnation cases. Memories of the intermission have been
reported in about 20% of the reincarnation cases that researchers have
studied (Matlock & Giesler-Petersen, 2016; Sharma & Tucker, 2004).
None of these cases have come from small-scale indigenous societies,
however. The Tlingit IEs described here are the first IEs from small-scale societies to be aired outside of the anthropological literature. All
were reported originally by the same ethnographers and came from
the same time period as the NDEs.
My juxtaposition of NDEs and IEs may be surprising, but there are
good reasons to consider these narratives together. NDEs typically
begin with an out-of-body experience (OBE) in which the experiencer
sees one’s body from the outside, then move on to a “transcendental”
phase that includes scenes of what in Western countries is commonly
regarded as Heaven, and conclude with return to the body. IEs likewise begin with the separation of consciousness from the body and
perception of events surrounding death, followed by discarnate adventures of varying duration, and then the selection of parents for
the next life and return to a body (Matlock & Giesler-Petersen, 2016;
Sharma & Tucker, 2004). Not all NDEs include all three stages, nor
do all IEs, yet these stages characterize the structure of the experiences cross-culturally. Both Western and non-Western NDEs and IEs
feature contacts with the spirits of deceased relatives and nonhuman
entities. In both, there may be perceptions of the material world. The
similarities of structure and core content in NDEs and IEs hint at
common processes at work in them.

**The Tlingit: People and Culture**

The Tlingit language is related to the Athapaskan languages that
western Canadian first nations’ peoples speak (Greenberg, 1987). This
linguistic similarity identifies the Tlingit as members of a migratory
wave into the Americas later than those that brought the native peoples from whom other Amerindian NDE accounts have been collected
(see Greenberg, Turner, & Zegura, 1986).
Archeologists have found that the Tlingit have lived in their present locale around Sitka on the Alaskan panhandle since at least 500
BCE (de Laguna, 1972). Their first known contact with non-natives
was with Russian trappers and traders in the 18th century. In the
early 19th century, the Russian Orthodox priest Ioan (Ivan) Veniaminov lived with the Tlingit, learned their language, and produced the

first comprehensive study of their culture (Kaserman, 2007; Veniaminov, 1840). After the purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867,
the Tlingit were visited by several American ethnographers, including
Boas, Knapp, and Swanton. In the 1950s, de Laguna conducted the
most extensive fieldwork with an inland group.
The Tlingit are organized into two intermarrying groups, called
moieties: the Raven and the Eagle or Wolf. Each moiety is subdivided
into matrilineal sibs, or clans, that are themselves composed of lineages, or houses. A child is born into its mother’s moiety and, upon
maturity, marries a member of its father’s moiety. Each moiety is associated with certain motifs, or crests, displayed on objects like totem
poles. The Tlingit live in permanent villages, supporting themselves
by hunting, fishing, and gathering nuts and berries. Their environment has allowed them to develop a rich culture that they share with
other societies in the region known to anthropologists as the Northwest Coast.
Northwest Coast societies are ranked between aristocracy and commoners. Historically, some of the aristocracy kept captives from other
tribes as slaves. Shamans had a prominent place as medicine men.
Central to the culture were great feasts, called potlatches, at which
the moieties alternated as hosts and guests. The most important potlatch was the mortuary potlatch, at which food was thrown into a fire
to feed the spirit of the recently deceased (Kan, 1989). A crackling fire
was thought to be the sound of the spirit asking to be fed. Traditionally the Tlingit cremated their dead, but by the 20th century, under
the influence of Christian missionaries, they were instead burying
them. The bodies of shamans were interred in a special graveyard.
Shamans and the elite often had grave houses, provided for use of the
spirit in the afterlife (de Laguna, 1972).
Like indigenous cultures the world over, the Tlingit subscribed to
an animistic worldview that posits a spirit domain parallel to everyday physical reality with the possibility of interaction between the living and dead. E. B. Tylor (1877), who first identified this outlook and
named it, showed it to be fundamentally experiential and empirical,
a conclusion derived from phenomena such as apparitions, dreams
in which deceased human figures appeared, mediumistic trances,
shamanic journeying, and what today are called NDEs and OBEs.
Members of many animistic cultures believe in reincarnation, on the
basis of dream announcements, telltale behaviors and birthmarks,
and claims by children to have lived before. Animism is sometimes
said to denote a belief that all objects or phenomena of the natural


-----

JAMES G. MATLOCK, PHD 219

world are imbued with spirits or souls, but this feature of animism is
not universal in indigenous societies (Matlock, 1993, 1995). Animism
should not be confused with shamanism, which refers to an array of
practices—​ ­that rest upon the animistic system. ­widely varying cross-culturally—​
The Tlingit believed that upon death an individual’s spirit travels
to one of three levels of heaven or lands of the dead. The spirits of
those who die by violence go to the uppermost heaven, called Kiwa’a,
where they are visible to the living as the Northern Lights. Kiwa’a is
presided over by an entity named Tahi’t. The spirits of those who die
nonviolent deaths go to a midlevel heaven, located across a river on the
same plane as the terrestrial world. Witches and other social outcasts
go to a lower-level (subterranean) Dog Heaven and are ineligible for
reincarnation. Spirits who have gone to either of the upper levels of
heaven may reincarnate at any time, ideally to a maternal relative, so
that they are in position to inherit the hereditary name and be eligible
to receive the tangible and intangible property of the deceased persons
with whom they are identified. Identifications are made on the basis
of signs that include birthmarks and other congenital scars, distinctive behaviors, and personality traits reminiscent of a deceased person. When they become old enough to speak, some children talk about
people and incidents from their past lives (de Laguna, 1972; Matlock,
1990a; Stevenson, 1966, 1974).

**Six Tlingit Near-Death Experiences**

**NDE Accounts**

The following six NDE accounts were collected and published by Boas
(1890), Knapp (Knapp & Childe, 1896), Swanton (1908), and de Laguna (1972). De Laguna (1972) and Knapp and Childe (1896) presented other accounts, but I found them to be either brief or repetitive
and to add little to those included here. To enable maximum exposure
of their details, rather than summarize these accounts, I quote them
verbatim from the original sources. They are presented in chronological order by their publication date and are numbered to facilitate reference to them later.
(1). The first NDE account is one of the earliest recorded, by Boas
(1890). It tells the story of a young shaman who apparently died and
was buried, then unexpectedly returned to life.

A shaman had been sick for many years. When he felt he could not
recover, and death was approaching, he asked his mother to take good

220 JOURNAL OF NEAR-DEATH STUDIES

care of his dog. He died. The corpse was wrapped in furs, and on the
fourth day he was buried in the graveyard of the shamans, near the
beach. Every day his mother went to the little house where his body
was deposited, bewailing his death, and burning food for him. One
day the dog, who had accompanied her, began to bark, and would not
be quieted. Suddenly she heard something moving in the grave, and a
sound as if someone was awakening after a long sleep. She fled, terrified, and told the people what she had heard. They went to the grave,
opened it, and found that the dead man had returned to life. They
carried him home, and gave him some food. But he felt weak, and it
was not until he had slept long and soundly that he began to speak.
“Mother,” he said, “why did you not give me to eat when I asked you?
Did you not hear me? I said, ‘I am hungry,’ and nudged you. I wanted
to touch your right side, but I was unable to do so. I was compelled by
a magic force to stand at your left side. You did not reply, but merely
touched your left side, saying, ‘That is a bad omen.’ When I saw you
eating, I asked you to let me take part in your meal, but you did not
answer, and without your permission I was not able to partake of any
food. You said, ‘The fire crackles,’ and you threw some of your meal
into it.
“When I was dead I did not feel any pain. I sat by my body, and
saw how you prepared it for burial, and how you painted my face with
our crest. I heard you, O mother, mourning at my grave. I told you
that I was not dead, but you did not hear me. After four days I felt
as though there was no day and no night. I saw you carrying away
my body, and felt compelled to accompany it, although I wished to
stay in our house. I asked every one of you to give me some food, but
you threw it into the fire, and then I felt satisfied. At last I thought,
‘I believe I am dead, for nobody hears me, and the burnt food satisfies
me,’ and I resolved to go into the land of the souls. Soon I arrived at
a fork in the road. A much-trodden road led the way, while the other
seemed to have been seldom used. I followed the former. I longed to
die, and went on and on, hoping to reach the country of the deceased.
At last I arrived at a steep rock, the end of the world. At the foot of
the rock a river flowed sluggishly. On the other side I saw a village,
and recognized many of its inhabitants. I saw my grandmother and
my uncle who have long been dead, and many children whom I had
once tried to cure. But many of those I saw I did not know. I cried,
‘Oh, come, have pity upon me! Take me over to you!’ But they continued to wander about as though they did not hear me. I was overcome
by weariness, and lay down. The hard rock was my pillow. I slept
soundly, and when I awoke I did not know how long I had slept. I
stretched my limbs and yawned. Then the people in the village cried,
‘Somebody is coming! Let us go and take him across the river!’ A boat
came to where I stood, and took me to the village. Everyone greeted
me kindly. I was going to tell them of this life, but they raised their
hands and motioned me to be silent, saying, ‘Don’t speak of these


-----

JAMES G. MATLOCK, PHD 221

matters; they do not belong to us.’ They gave me salmon and berries
to eat, but everything had a burnt taste, although it looked like good
food; therefore I did not touch it. They gave me water, but as I was
about to drink it I found that it looked green and had a bitter taste.
They told me that the river which I had crossed was formed of the
tears shed by the women over the dead; therefore you must not cry
until your dead friend has crossed the river.
“I thought, ‘I came here to die, but the spirits lead a miserable
life. I will rather endure the pains my mother inflicts upon me than
stay here.’ The spirits asked me to stay, but I was not moved by their
entreaties, and left. As soon as I turned round, the river had disappeared, and I found myself on a path that was seldom trodden by man.
I went on and on, and saw many hands growing out of the ground,
and moving towards me, as though they were making something. Far
away I saw a great fire, and close behind it was a sword swinging
around. When I followed the narrow path I saw many eyes, which
were all fixed upon me. But I did not mind them, for I wanted to die,
and I went on and on. The fire was still at a distance. At last I reached
it, and then I thought, ‘What shall I do? My mother does not hear me.
I hate the life of the spirits. I will die a violent death, and go to Tahi’t

[in Kiwa’a]. I put my head into the fire, right where the swords are
swinging round. Then all of a sudden I felt cold. I heard my dog barking and my mother crying. I stretched my limbs, peeped through the
walls of my little grave, and saw you, O my mother, running away.
I called my dog; he came to see me, and then you arrived and found
me alive. Many would like to return from the country of the spirits,
but they dread the hands, the eyes, and the fire; therefore the path is
almost obliterated.” (Boas, 1890, pp. 843–844)

(2). Frances Knapp (Knapp & Childe, 1896) reported a second account, which was said to have occurred sometime in the indefinite
past. She mentioned two other NDEs briefly (pp. 160–161) but said
that in the main they had similar features to the following. Again, the
experience is related to what appeared to be a natural death.

The soul of one Mutsak, it is claimed, left the body for two whole days,
then returned to give the world this strange story:
“ The path to the river led over a steep hill choked with briers and
devil’s club. Without thick shoes and stockings I could not have made
my way at all. Beasts of the forest attacked me on every side, but my
war paint and brave knife soon frightened them away. I reached the
river and shouted with all my might. A boatman responded to my call,
and in a few minutes appeared and conveyed me across the stream to
spirit-land.
“In great haste I set out to find my uncle. To my surprise, he did not
seem glad to see me; looked at me sorrowfully, and I almost thought
reproachfully, and said:


-----

222 JOURNAL OF NEAR-DEATH STUDIES

“ ‘My nephew, what has brought you here? Are you hungry? Do not
eat, I beg of you! Hurry back, as fast as ever you can, to the good home
you have left!’ ”
“I turned my back on him, somewhat indignant, and proceeded
alone to make the rounds of the village. There were four rows of
houses, I found, and those longest dead lived in the last tier. Before each row I dropped a blanket as I passed. Such misery I never
dreamed of. Spirit-land is full of unhappy ones! Each house had its
fire-place, but only those whose bodies had been burned could enjoy
their warmth. Several souls sat in one corner of a great, square room,
shivering with cold. ‘Why don’t you draw nearer the fire?’ I asked. ‘We
can’t,’ they answered mournfully; ‘our bodies were never burned.’
“Other poor souls were starving. ‘Return home,’ they begged me,
‘return and tell our people how we suffer through their carelessness.
They have given us no food for this entire year.’
“Others again had scarcely any clothing. ‘Our people are to blame,’
they complained, with great bitterness. ‘They have neglected to remember us with blankets.’
“My mother’s spirit came to me, and said, ‘You have a great mission. Go home and tell the Indians what your experience has taught
you. Give them also this message for me: It is not enough to provide
the spirits with food; they are thirsty, and a bottle or dish of water
should be buried by the funeral pyre.
“ ‘Also say to them that when a dead body lies in a house where
there is a child, unless they want another death in the family, they
should split the end of a small stick, fill it with charcoal, and place it
by the child’s bed with the split end pointing toward spirit-land. Or,
better still, tell them to hang a row of halibut hooks along the side of
the room. Spirits are afraid of halibut hooks.’
“So, one by one, they came to me bringing their messages. They
were so anxious that I should leave, that they commenced beating
me and clubbing me, until I was glad to run away.” (Knapp & Childe,
1896, pp. 157–160)

(3). The next NDE account explains the origin of the mortuary potlatch and other aspects of how the Tlingit treated their dead. Again,
there is a nonviolent death and travel to the midlevel heaven.

In olden days a certain person died and thought it was so hard to
walk up to the ghosts’ country that he came back. Then he said to the
people, “I haven’t any moccasins. I haven’t any gloves on. That is a
very hard place to go up through, for there are lots of devil clubs and
other kinds of bushes along the way. You must also sing songs when
anybody dies. It is the same as a road for him and will lead him. There
are wolves and bears along the way, which one has to protect himself
against.” So the people gave him moccasins and gloves and put a knife
in his hand so that he could defend himself. He also said that there


-----

JAMES G. MATLOCK, PHD 223

were many houses there, and told them to dress him up, put red paint
on his face, and eagle down on his hair. He had come to life only to
explain how the dead should be treated, so after he had told them all
those things he passed away again. Just before going he said, “When
the fire crackles at a certain time—​ ­for that is the only way they can
talk to you in this world—​ ­it is because the spirits are hungry. You
must then put grease, berries, and other kinds of food into the fire.”
The first time he died, the spirits asked, “What did your people give
you to eat when you started on your journey?” So, nowadays when
anyone dies people always give feasts to feed the spirits. In the places
which people reach after death there are many houses in rows, and
the spirits assemble in those houses to share the food sent up from
this world. All of the grave houses are named by the spirits, who give
the same names to their houses in the ghost country. (Swanton, 1908,
p. 461)

(4). The fourth NDE account also involves a nonviolent death and
travel to the midlevel heaven.

When a Wolf man at Sitka was about to give a feast the fire began
crackling and he said angrily, “Why don’t you spirits work for food
and blankets? You always want people to give them to you.” As soon
as this man was through feasting he fell sick and two days afterwards
he said, “Numbers of spirits have come to welcome me.” Then he died.
So his friends began to dress him up in his war clothes and they put
a war spear in his hands. After a time, however, he came to life again
and told the people what he had seen. He said that he had seen lots
of people outside on the porches of the grave houses. One of these, a
chief who had died long ago, spoke from his porch, saying, “Do you
think the spirits are getting starved that you talk to us that way? We
are not getting starved. Do you think that you are going to destroy all
the spirits with that war spear? ” And on account of the war spear they
sent him back into the world. The man also said that that is “an everlasting place” (i.e., a very large one), like a regular town, and added,
“Whenever any man is going to give a feast for one who has died they
feel very happy over it there.” The man died and came back to life four
times, after which the war spear was taken from him and he died for
good. (Swanton, 1908, pp. 462–463)

(5). A fifth account, contributed by de Laguna (1972), concerns a boy
named Laxkunik who was spanked by his mother for some infraction
and sent to his room without supper. Later he was found apparently
dead. His body was dressed in a blanket and prepared for cremation.
The narrative relates his experiences before he returned to life the following morning, 12 hours later. Material in parenthesis is part of the
original text, whereas that in brackets has been added for clarification.

He [the spirit of the boy] sits over there (the narrator pointed to a box
against the back wall of the room).
Then he goes around, [the spirit of] that little boy. Running like
that—​ ­he goes around. It’s half raining and half snow. . . . It was sleeting and raining, he said [when he returned to his body]. All the people
were singing. . . . Then afterwards, you know, are songs, singing it like
that—​ ­just like they pray this time.
He goes. Then he sees the road, a little trail. After a while he sees
a river like that. He sits right by it. He sees people on the other side.
They got (a wooden headdress) on too, and blanket.
He called them, “Go over here. I want to go on to the other side.”
Nobody listen to him.
Then after awhile, he’s getting sleepy. That’s his spirit. His body’s
way back inside his mother’s house. He’s yawning.
They hear it. “Somebody on the other side!” they said. “Where’s the
boat? . . . Take a boat and bring him in the house.” . . .
“Somebody on the other side. Where’s the boat?”
They got the boat. They take him to the other side.
First house they came in, his aunty’s house. His aunt is right by
the door over there. She’s standing over here. . . . All the people were
sitting in four circles around the house, the oldest in back.
The girl said, “Sit down, I’m going to tell you something.” She
didn’t lose her mind. She thought about her people in this world. . . .
“Sit down,” says that woman. She just fresh yet, you know (recently
dead). “Don’t eat anything from these people. I’m going to help you get
back on the other side. You’re going home.” That’s what she said, that
woman. “Sit down here. Don’t go away from me. It’s by accident I stay
here. . . . I ate something, so I’m here. . . . These people is no good,” she
says, his father’s sister. He sat beside her. . . .
“Don’t eat anything. If you eat anything from them you’re going to
stay here.”
After a while, everybody sleepy. When they were sleeping, she
sneaks him over to the other side.
“Run as fast as you can. Don’t think of us. After that crow (raven)
sounds, you aren’t going to come back. (I.e., he had to return home
before the raven called, or he would never be able to do so.) He runs.
Afterwards he sees that house (his own home). He sees that corner.
He wants to come in. He can’t make it. After a while he stands against
the corner, and they say, “He’s coming to alive! He’s coming to alive!”
(de Laguna, 1972, pp. 775–776)

(6). The last NDE account describes a visit to Kiwa’a, the highest
level of heaven, reserved for those who die by violence. An aristocratic
man and his slave allowed themselves to be shot in order to go there
in search of a lost crest object called a “totem pole” in the narrative.


-----

JAMES G. MATLOCK, PHD 225


So when they’re going to look [for the crest object], they’re going to go
up, they shoot them—​ ­shoot both of them. So the spirit can go up to
Kiwa’a. That man, he was leading. He was the first to get shot, that’s
why he was first. His slave was right behind him.
What he see is some berry bushes—​ ­salmonberries, thick, as big as
the hand, ripe. Oh, he like to eat some, but his slave is right behind
him, pushing him. “Don’t touch that berries!” But he like to eat some.
It looks good.
They go up there. Green grass—​ ­beautiful! And the watchman
standing there, guard. Right away the watch-out man mention his
name, that he came up. He see everybody run to where he come up—​
­just a hole. Just green grass—​ ­beautiful! Woman and man running,
everybody, to meet them.
They take him to the house. That house owner, the head man, he
mention his name, that man. “We didn’t expect this man up here,”
he said. “We didn’t expect him. We keep the fire burning for—.” I forgot his name. “We keep the fire burning for—​ ­.” He mention another
name—​ ­“Yisganalx. We keep the fire burning for Yisganalx.” It’s a different name, he mention it. “But we didn’t expect this man to come.
We keep the fire burning for Yisganalx.”
That’s what the chief said—​ ­anyway, the head house owner.
And they got a pot on the fire. I don’t know the name of that ducks,
in the water, diving all the time . . . small ducks like saw bills. But
they stay in the sea all the time. That’s the meat, they boiling it.
“But we didn’t expect you,” he said.
Then he said, “I didn’t expect to come up here myself,” he said. “I’m
looking for that totem pole.”
And that man answers him again, that house owner. “We don’t
know anything like a totem pole up here. The only thing we know
is Yisaganalx is going to come, so we keep the fire burning until he
come.”

[The man relates the story of the lost crest object.]
Soon as they finish this story, that slave of that man just grab him
on the shoulder, that man. “Let’s go!”
The slave push him ahead. They run, they jump down where they
come from. On the way down they see the salmonberry bushes. It’s
blood. When they coming up it looks like berries, but it’s all blood
clots. The slave knows it. He’s smarter than this fellow.
And they come back down and the bodies come back alive. They
don’t find him, that totem pole. See, that’s the way they know how it’s
up in heaven.
After they come back alive, little bit afterwards, that man [Yisa­

ganalx] get killed. That’s what they [the spirits in Kiwa’a] expect, they
keep the fire burning. (de Laguna, 1972, pp. 772–773)

**Discussion**

The Tlingit belong to a distinctly different cultural group than the
other Amerindian peoples from whom NDEs have been reported, and
many details of the Tlingit NDEs are specific to them. It bears repeating that these ethnographic accounts may have been passed down for
generations before being recorded in writing. They have the status of
folklore, falling far short of modern standards of data collection and
investigation in psychology and parapsychology. Nonetheless, they
display several familiar patterns.
A journey along a spirit road figures in six of Wade’s (2003) 11 historical accounts (from seven Amerindian cultures), as well as in the
autobiographical Hopi case of Sun Chief (Talayesva, 1942) analyzed
by Green (2008), and in several of the NDEs referenced by Shushan
(2016). It is described in four of the five Tlingit narratives relating
to the mid-level heaven (1, 2, 3, 5). In five of Wade’s (2003) accounts,
the experiencers (NDErs) reached the land of the dead, as they did in
five of the Tlingit narratives (1, 2, 4, 5, 6). The NDErs saw deceased
people in six of Wade’s (2003) accounts, in Gómez-Jeria’s (1993) Mapuche case, in many of those mentioned by Shushan (2016), and in all of
the Tlingit narratives. Wade (2003) identified nonhuman beings in six
accounts, although none appeared in the cases of Talayesva or Gómez-Jeria or in any of the Tlingit narratives.
Four of the NDErs in Wade’s accounts received a commission to
carry out upon returning to corporeal life, and three others created a mission for themselves. Missions are routinely given in the
revitalization-movement NDEs referenced by Shushan (2016). NDErs
returned with a mission in two of the Tlingit narratives (2, 3). NDErs
were told to return in four of Wade’s accounts as well as in Talayesva’s
(1942) and Gómez-Jeria’s (1993) cases. The return was unintentional
in two of Wade’s (2003) accounts. NDErs returned by choice in two
Tlingit accounts (3, 6), were sent back in two (2, 4), returned with assistance in one (5), and returned unintentionally in one (1). Partaking
of spirit food was associated with the inability to return in three of the
Tlingit narratives (1, 5, 6), although the consumption of food burned
in a potlatch had no effect (1). NDErs interacted with the living in
two of Wade’s (2003) accounts and in one of the Tlingit narratives (1).
NDErs perceived people and events in the material world in one of
Wade’s (2003) accounts, in Green’s (2008), and in two of the Tlingit
narratives (1, 5).
Several of these features appear also in NDEs reported from small-­

scale societies in Oceania, Australia, and Africa (Counts, 1983; Kellehear, 2008, 2009; McClenon, 2006a). McClenon (2006a) noted that
journeys along a path to a spirit world, encounters with the spirits of
deceased persons and nonhuman beings, and returns because it was
not the NDErs time to die, sometimes with commissions to perform
certain activities, appeared in historical BaKongo and Basuto NDE
narratives. A land of the dead located in the heavens and nonhuman
spirits identified with Jesus appeared in the more Christianized accounts. Similar features turned up in accounts and cases from Australia (Berndt & Berndt, 1989; Warner, 1937), New Zealand (King,
1985), Papua New Guinea (Counts, 1983), Guam (Green, 1984), and
Hawaii (Kellehear, 2001), as well as in five cases reported to Morse
and Perry (1992) from contemporary Zaire.
Kellehear (2008, 2009) contrasted state-level Asian societies with
hunter-gatherer and other small-scale indigenous societies, pointing
to the presence or absence of a life review—​ ­present in the state-level
accounts, absent in others—​ ­as being the main discriminating variable. Light and darkness impressions are unusual in NDEs from non-­

Western societies of all types. I think, however, that Kellehear (2008,
2009) missed something significant in the data. There appear to be
two distinct subgroups of non-Western societies. In state-level societies, the deceased found themselves in some sort of celestial heaven,
but in small-scale societies, the land of the dead most often lay on the
same plane as the terrestrial world and only occasionally was situated
below or above ground. When the land of dead was in the sky, as in
many of the NDEs Shushan (2016) NDEs reported, there often were
indicators of contact influences on the society.
Additionally, there were more mentions of deceased humans and
fewer mentions of nonhuman beings in NDEs reported from small-scale societies than in NDEs reported from state-level societies. There
were no nonhuman beings in the Tlingit accounts or in the Hopi (Talayesva, 1942) or Mapuche (Gómez-Jeria, 1993) cases, and they were
unusual in the NDEs reported from small-scale societies in Africa
(McClenon, 2006a), Australia (Berndt & Berndt, 1989; Warner, 1937),
and Oceania (Counts, 1983; Green, 1984; Kellehear, 2001; King, 1985).
Nonhuman beings were more prominent in acculturated NDEs, such
as many of those that Shushan (2016) and Morse (1992) described. By
contrast, nonhuman beings figured prominently in NDEs from China
(Becker, 1981; McClenon, 1991), Japan (Becker, 1984; McClenon,
1991; Ohkado & Greyson, 2014), India (Pasricha, 1993, 2008; Pasricha & Stevenson, 1986), and Thailand (Murphy, 2001, n.d.).

Kellehear (2008, 2009) could discern no pattern regarding OBEs
in relation to NDEs. Perceptions of the material world need not be
limited to the initial phase of an NDE, so from my perspective restricting perceptions to an OBE “stage,” as analysts have often done,
is misleading. Perceptions may have, but by no means always or even
regularly have, included views of the NDEr’s body, and when the body
was seen, the sight may have come at the end rather than at the beginning of the experience (Talayesva, 1942; Thrum, 1907/1998). During
his NDE in Paris, Black Elk had the sense of flying over the Pine
Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, observing a situation he could not
have known about normally (Neihardt, 1932/1988). Given that perceptions of the material world may occur at any time during an NDE
(see also Rivas, Dirven, & Smit, 2016), it might be wise to reconsider
the relationship between OBEs and NDEs. If consciousness separates
from the body during an NDE, NDEs by definition are OBEs, whether
they include perceptions of the material world or not. The incidence of
reported perceptions varies across individuals and cultures, but so do
all NDE features, and it may be a mistake to place much emphasis on
the variability of perception of the material world. That it happens at
all surely is the essential point.

**Three Tlingit Intermission Experiences**

**IE Accounts**

(7). The Tlingit classify suicide as a violent death. This first IE account, from Boas (1890), tells of a man who killed himself and went to
Kiwa’a and met Tahi’t before being reborn.

A man named Ky’itl’a ˉ’c, who lived about seven generations ago, killed
himself. When he died he saw a ladder descending from heaven, and
he ascended it. At the head of the ladder he met an old watchman, who
was all black, and had curly hair. He asked, ‘What do you want here?’
When Ky’itl’a ˉ’c told him he had killed himself, the watchman allowed
him to pass. Soon he discovered a large house, and saw a kettle standing in front of it. In the house he saw Tahi’t, who beckoned him to
come in. He called two of his people (who are called Kye ˉwak’a ˉ’o) and
ordered him to show Ky’itl’a ˉ’c the whole country. They led him to the
Milky Way, and to a lake in which two white geese were swimming.
They gave him a small stone and asked him to try and hit the geese
with it. He complied with their request, and as soon as he had shot the
geese they began to sing. This made him laugh, for their singing felt
as though somebody tickled him. Then his companions asked him, ‘Do
you wish to see Tahi’t’s daughters?’ When he expressed his desire they
opened the cloud door, and he saw two bashful young girls beyond

[below] the clouds. When he looked down upon them he saw the tops
of the trees looking like so many pins. But he wished to return to the
earth. He pulled his blanket over his head and flung himself down.
He arrived at the earth unhurt, and found himself at the foot of some
trees. Soon he discovered a small house, the floor of which was covered
with mats. He peeped into it, and heard a child crying that had just
been born. He himself was the child, and when he came to be grown
up he told the people of Tahi’t. They had heard about him before, but
only then they learnt everything about the upper world. Ky’itl’a ˉ’c told
that those whose heads had been cut off had their eyes between their
shoulders in the upper world. (Boas, 1890, pp. 844–845)

(8). The second IE account also involves a violent death and a trip to
Kiwa’a. Two men were shot and killed. One was reborn as his grandson, Qawusa. De Laguna (1972) recorded two versions of this story, of
which I give only one. See de Laguna (1972, p. 774) for the other.

There were two of them [who were killed]. When they shot them,
it was like blood splashed on them. . . . It was his grandfather [the
grandfather of Qawusa] and another man [who were killed].
When they looked around them, there were steps coming down.
They started to walk on those steps. When they came up there, they
found a lot of people who had been shot before. There’s nothing going
on there but playing around, playing around all the time. And most of
them going after water. People going after water—​ ­that’s the Northern
Lights.
It’s cold. It’s always cold up there.
They are playing something like that hockey. . . . Sometimes they
jump around this—​ ­they call it (greenstone). That’s the hardest rocks,
kind of green color. They (the rocks) just sticks out. They jump through
that, just jumping between them—​ ­just sticking out like tacks. . . .
And this man [who reincarnated as Qawusa], he jumped on one
(sharp stone). And they kicked him out [of Kiwa’a] for that.
He remembered when he started to fall. And somebody said he was
born again. They recognized him. They said his name, and he said
something, but they were scared, so they said nothing.
When he was born, they find some birthmarks.
When he started to talk, he started telling this story, and every
time he started telling the story, there’s always something that happens, so he has to stop. My mother knows that story pretty well. And
he never did finish that story. (de Laguna, 1972, pp. 773–774)

(9). The story of ‘Askadut, from de Laguna (1972), last of the three
accounts that culminate in reincarnation, is the only one related to
a natural death and travel to the midlevel heaven. It is said to have
occurred in an unspecified but apparently distant past. Readers are
to understand that ‘Askadut described his reincarnation experience
when he became old enough to speak.

230 JOURNAL OF NEAR-DEATH STUDIES


‘Askadut was a Sitka man who died (of smallpox, one informant believed). He did not know that he was dead. He could see his own body,
sitting propped up, as they used to prop up a body before burning it.
He tried in vain to get back inside his body, “to get under his cover,”
but he couldn’t.
His young wife, his father and mother, his sister and brother-in-­

law were all in the house grieving for him. ‘Askadut tried to tell his
mother and his wife that he was still alive, but they couldn’t hear
him, and when he put his arms around them they just sighed, “uh, uh,
uh,” with dry sobs. He became angry when he found himself unable to
sleep with his wife as formerly.
His relatives had called different tribes (sibs) to come to comfort
them, and they were having a feast together. ‘Askadut knew that
this feast was for him, but he couldn’t eat it. He became hungry and
touched his brother-in-law. “Why don’t you give me anything to eat?”
This man exclaimed: “Ha, my body twitches and at the same time the
fire also makes a noise.”
The fire crackled whenever the dead man spoke, but ‘Askadut was
unable to take any of the food until they put some of what his wife was
eating or drinking into a dish and set this in the fire.
Then they took the body out to where they were going to burn it.
He followed, and was afraid that it would hurt him, but when they
started to burn his body it felt to him just as if he were getting warm.
He watched them burning it.
When it [his body] was all consumed, the people left, but ‘Askadut
was unable to follow them. He didn’t know what was holding him
back, but he stayed by the ashes until he began to think of the place
where the dead people go.
­in the rain and sleet, though devilclubs and underbrush with thorns. He had a hard time, without rough So he started to walk there—​
clothes, or shoes or gloves to protect him. His hands became scratched
and sore. He had a hard time because he had waited too long at the
pyre.
Finally he came to the bank of a river, a muddy river that he
couldn’t cross, and yet he knew that he was supposed to go to the other
side, where he could see the village and people. He called and called
to them, but they couldn’t hear. Finally he became tired and yawned.
Then immediately the people heard him and became excited. They
fetched him across the river in a canoe.
There were many people, a big town. He went inside one of the
houses.
It is not quite clear why or how ‘Askadut left the land of the dead.
MJ [one of de Laguna’s informants] said it was because “He wanted to
come back to his family so bad.” According to EE [another informant],
his aunt was among the recent dead and recognized him. She told him
to go back and helped him across the river. . . .
He followed the river and after a hard time finally got back (near

his home?). He was tired, and sat down at the foot of a tree near the
riverbank. The tree began to drip, so he moved to another, and found
a dry one with a branch sticking out and a nice mossy place under it.
Here he sat down, leaning against the tree. He fell asleep right there.
Here he remained for nine days. Each day the river bank caved in,
a little bit at a time, and heard the splash of the mud and sand falling
into the water. Soon it came close to his foot, and he thought, “I’ll wait
till it comes closer, then I’ll move away.” But he couldn’t move anymore. And then it was caving away almost under him, and he thought,
“Well, wait till I fall down that one, then I’ll climb out of there.”
And then it caved underneath him, and he fell down the bank into
the water. And he heard someone say, “He’s born already!”
They took the baby up. He looked around for his mother, and it was
his true sister! [i.e., ‘Askadut’s sister].
And his [former] mother said, “Oh, my son come back! That’s
‘Askadut’s spirit!”
“Yes, that’s me. My name is ‘Askadut,” the baby said [when he became old enough to speak.] “I came back. You cried so much, and I
heard my wife weeping, so I came back.”
His wife recognized the baby as her husband, apparently by a cut
or scar on his foot. And he reached for his wife with a smile.
But he was so ashamed of his sister that he wouldn’t suck her
breast, and they had to get a woman of a different tribe (sib, in the
opposite moiety) to suckle him.
So it was from ‘Askadut that they learned about the dead, and
what to do when people die. (de Laguna, 1972, pp. 767–768)

**Discussion**

I find the similarities in structure and content between the three IEs
and six NDEs to be striking. ‘Askadut (9) traveled a path to the midlevel heaven, situated across a river on the terrestrial plane. Residents
of the spirit village were not aware of his presence until he yawned,
then sent a canoe to fetch him. ‘Askadut (9) observed his mortuary
potlatch, and his brother-in-law’s body twitched when he tried to
touch him. All three accounts (7, 8, 9) included meetings with spirits,
but only in the first, describing a visit to Kiwa’a (7), were there nonhuman beings. Also in all three accounts the decision to reincarnate
was either voluntary or assisted by another spirit. Perceptions of the
material world were mentioned in two accounts (7, 9).
Ethnographies of other native North American societies contain al-
lusions to intermission memories (Matlock & Mills, 1994), but in only
two other instances known to me are they described in any detail.
In one, a Winnebago shaman named Thunder Cloud recalled two


-----

previous lives and two intermissions (Radin, 1923, 1926/1983). During the first intermission, he was taken “to the place where the sun
sets.” He thought about being reborn but was told to ask permission
of Earthmaker, who granted it so that he could help avenge those who
had killed him and his kinsmen. During the second intermission, he
watched his own burial, then was led away “toward the land of the setting sun.” There he found a village where he remained for four years,
before being reborn a second time (Radin, 1926/1983, pp. 5–6). Here
again the land of the dead was on the terrestrial plane, rather than
above the earth. Thunder Cloud encountered spirits of the deceased
as well as a nonhuman being, Earthmaker. At the end of Thunder
Cloud’s first intermission, Earthmaker approved his return to physical embodiment. During his second intermission, Thunder Cloud perceived the material world.
The other Amerindian IE comes from the eastern Kutchin (or
Gwich’in), an Athapascan group in Canada’s Northwest Territories.
It is an instructive account because it includes clearly acculturated
elements derived from Christian missionary teachings. A 6-year-old
girl told her mother that after dying before, she had walked up to the
sky on a steep and narrow trail until she came to the gate to heaven.
There she had met St. Peter, who admitted her, and she walked on,
passing many other human spirits, until she encountered Jesus. Jesus
told her that it was not her time to die and sent her back to earth to be
reborn as her sister (Slobodin, 1994, p. 151).
I know of no other detailed IE accounts from small-scale societies
elsewhere in the world, even though reincarnation beliefs and signs
appear in indigenous cultures on every continent (Matlock, 1993).
However, Tlingit, Winnebago, and Kutchin IEs can be compared to
those reported as part of reincarnation cases in state-level societies.
Gerald Willoughby-Meade (1928) contributed an IE in a reincarnation account he discovered in a book from 8th century China. After
death, a spirit (or “soul”) remained in its former house, where it observed its erstwhile family. It heard its father, Ku Huang, lament the
death of his son, and it decided to return to the family. “Presently the
soul felt that it was being seized and sent before an Official of the Underworld, who ordered it to be reborn as a child in the Ku household,”
Willoughby-Meade (1928, p. 76) recounted. Notice not only that the
spirit watched the family while in its discarnate state but also that its
return to embodied life was sanctioned by a nonhuman spirit in the
underworld.
Iris Giesler-Petersen and I made a statistical comparison of fea-

tures of Asian and Western IEs in modern reincarnation cases, in the
majority of which the previous person had been identified and the subject’s statements about the previous life had been confirmed (Matlock
& Giesler-Petersen, 2016). Our sample consisted of 85 IEs, 58 from
Asian countries and 27 from Western countries. We found the experiences from the two world areas to be remarkably similar. We found
no statistically significant differences in the presence or absence of
Stage 2 or 3 intermission experiences—​ ­discarnate existence, return
to a new body—​ ­or in many of the characteristics of those stages between the two world areas. A variety of spirit entities, including deceased relatives and friends and nonhuman beings, appeared in both
world areas. Veridical perceptions of the material world were reported
during all three stages in both world areas.
The strongest contrast Giesler-Petersen and I found between Asian
and Western IEs was in the nature of the discarnate environment.
Whereas Asians usually said that they stayed close to the earth, Westerners spoke of going to Heaven. A few subjects in both Asia and the
West talked about moving between terrestrial and heavenly environments. The difference between the proportions of terrestrial, heavenly, and both environments in Asian versus Western IEs was highly
statistically significant ( _p_ < .000001). This result is noteworthy, given
the tendency for IEs and NDEs in small-scale societies to locate the
land of the dead on the terrestrial plane. However, in the Asian IEs
with terrestrial experiences, the interlife period passed in a specific
real-world place, such as a pagoda or a tree, rather than in a special
land of the dead (Matlock & Geisler-Petersen, 2016).
Cultural expectations clearly impact IEs just as they do NDEs.
Giesler-Petersen and I noted cultural imprints not only in the representation of the discarnate environment, but also in how nonhuman
beings were identified. God, Jesus, and angels regularly figured in
Western IEs, whereas in Asia, the nonhuman actors were likely to
be Yama, the Hindu king or god of the dead, and sundry minor deities and devas. Significantly, though, the different nonhuman entities
filled the same roles in both world areas. We named these roles Gatekeeper, Escort, Entity in Charge, and Other.
When nonhuman beings appeared in Tlingit, Winnebago, and
Kutchin IEs, they assumed the same roles. The intermission experiencer (IEr) in account 7 was met by a Gatekeeper at the entrance to
Kiwa’a. Later he encountered Tahi’t, an Entity in Charge, who sent
him on a tour of Kiwa’a with a pair of Escorts. The Escorts assisted in
his reincarnation to a young woman who was described as a daughter


-----

234 JOURNAL OF NEAR-DEATH STUDIES

of Tahi’t, in the same sense that one might speak of a “child of God.” In
both of Thunder Cloud’s IEs, he was met by an Escort who showed him
to the land of the dead. Earthmaker, the Winnebago Entity in Charge,
approved his plan to reincarnate later on. In the Kutchin case, St. Peter filled the role of Gatekeeper, and Jesus was the Entity in Charge.
When nonhuman beings appear in NDEs, it is typically in one
of these roles as well. In Black Elk’s first NDE, nonhuman beings,
whom he described as looking like men, acted as Escorts (Neihardt,
1932/1988). In Sun Chief’s NDE (Talayesva, 1942), his guardian spirit
acted as Escort. In more acculturated accounts (Green, 1984; McClenon, 2006; Shushan, 2016), the Entity in Charge often was identified
as Jesus. In small-scale societies, the roles might be filled by the spirits of deceased humans as well as by nonhuman spirits. It was usually
nonhuman beings who acted as assistants in selecting parents for the
next life, but in the account of ‘Askadut (9), it was a deceased aunt.

**Conclusion**

Much has been made of the contrast between Western and non-Western
NDEs (Kellehear, 2008, 2009), but little notice has been taken of differences in subclasses of non-Western NDEs or of the similarities between NDEs and IEs. As illustrated by the Tlingit narratives, there
are good reasons to view NDEs and IEs as closely related. These experiences are structurally similar, the main difference being that in
NDEs, the experiencer returns to the same body in the end, whereas
in IEs, death is final and the return is to a different body. Both types
of experience include interaction with spirits and in both there may be
perceptions of the material world. In my concluding remarks, I reflect
on the implications of these observations for understanding the NDE.
First, let me say that I believe that research conducted over the last
half-century—​ ­has established reincarnation beyond reasonable doubt (Haraldsson & Matlock, 2016; Matlock, 1990b). ­since about 1960—​
Most of the work has been done with young children who claim to remember having lived before (Stevenson, 2001). Their memories occur
in the waking state or, less often, in dreams. Upon investigation, the
people the children talked about were identified, and much of what
they said happened was subsequently verified. Often the children displayed emotions appropriate to the persons whose lives they recalled,
and behaved in other ways like them. Frequently, there were birthmarks and other physical signs linking the lives. The files at the Uni-

versity of Virginia contain some 1,700 cases of this sort in which the
previous person has been identified (Mills & Tucker, 2013).
Children who spoke about the intermission made more verified
statements about the past life and were more likely to recall more
than one past life than were children who did not recall the intermission, suggesting that children with intermission memories have stronger memories over all (Sharma & Tucker, 2004). This finding does
not mean their intermission narratives must be taken literally, but
when children accurately describe scenes that took place after their
deaths in the earlier lives (Matlock & Giesler-Petersen, 2016; Rivas,
Carman, Carman, & Dirven, 2015), it does appear that somehow they
were around to witness those events. At the same time, both IEs and
NDEs contain a good deal of information that cannot be determined
to be either fact or fantasy. Despite the cross-cultural agreement in
structure and core content, there is strong evidence of cultural influence on these experiences. There is a good deal of individual variation,
too. Reconciliation of these seemingly contradictory elements presents
a challenge.
Because reincarnation entails survival of physical death, at least it
can be asserted that IEs provide prima facie evidence of a discarnate
existence between lives. The correspondences between NDEs and IEs
increase the likelihood that NDEs are what they seem to be: experiences of consciousness freed from cerebral domination and separated
from the body. If indeed that is what is occurring in NDEs, descriptions of similar phenomena should be expected under other conditions
where the brain’s constraints are reduced or removed; this, in fact, is
the case. Fantastic terrains and discarnate spirits are apprehended
in fasting and initiation rituals, ecstatic trance, the experiences of Tibetan delogs _,_ shamanic journeys, deathbed visions, terminal lucidity,
and the like (Bailey, 2001; Eliade, 1964; Kelly, Greyson, & Kelly, 2007;
Nahm, 2011; Osis & Haraldsson, 2012; Rousseau, 2012).
Philosopher H. H. Price (1953) portrayed the discarnate state as
dreamlike, but that depiction is at odds with what NDErs, IErs, and
other experiencers describe. In a large study of NDEs at the University of Virginia hospital, researchers found that 45% of NDErs said
their thinking had been “clearer than usual,” and another 40% said
it had been “as clear as usual” during the experience (Kelly, Greyson, & Kelly, 2007, p. 386 n16). Experiencers talked in realistic terms
about the spirits they saw and interacted with, even when settings
were fantastic. Some experiencers influenced living people or the ma-

terial world from the discarnate state, and some NDErs believed they
had traveled to places where living people saw them as apparitions
(Rivas, Dirven, & Smit, 2016, chap. 7). None of these narratives sound
like dreaming, but they are what would be expected if consciousness,
along with its capacities for complex thought and deliberative action,
persisted from embodiment into disembodiment.
During embodied life, consciousness has both conscious and subconscious strata, and there is no reason to suppose this is not true
of the discarnate mind as well. While minds are embodied, brain
physiology shapes conscious awareness (Augustine, 2007b; Augustine & Fishman, 2015), but that fact does not mean that the brain
generates consciousness or that it impacts the subconscious (Matlock,
2016). This last point is important, I think, because much of what
makes us humans who we are derives from the subconscious, and if
our subconscious minds survive our deaths, they would reasonably
be expected to carry forward our memories, behavioral dispositions,
convictions, beliefs, and other facets of our personalities that make the
subconscious their home. The dividing line between the subconscious
and conscious awareness may be more permeable in death, allowing
material from the subconscious to rise into awareness more easily, but
NDEs, IEs, and kindred phenomena suggest that the line does not
dissolve completely.
In the disembodied state, minds are bereft of physical senses and
cannot engage circumstances in the same ways as when they are embodied. Discarnate existence must be more pervasively subjective
than embodied life, but it need not be entirely subjective, because perceptions and interactions are possible through what parapsychologists
term “psi” (Matlock, 2016). Psi is an umbrella label for extra-sensory
perception (ESP), a category that includes clairvoyance, telepathy,
and psychokinesis (PK), mind over matter. Psi has been amply demonstrated in spontaneous cases and lab experiments for over 100 years,
and it appears to be a fundamental property of consciousness (Matlock, 2016). If living people possess psi capabilities, it is reasonable
to assume that discarnate minds do, as well. Indeed, I have noted
indications of psi-based perceptions and interactions with the living
in IEs. For documentation of veridical psi in NDEs, see Holden (2009)
and Rivas, Dirven, and Smit (2016).
Perceptions are handled in different ways by embodied and disembodied minds. Inputs passing through physical senses are mediated
by brains, but psi impressions enter subconscious minds and are processed there before being presented to conscious awareness (Marshall,

2015, pp. 394–401; Price, 1995). Augustine (2007a, 2007b, 2015b)
seemed to think that discarnate perception should be as clear and accurate as physical perception, and because it sometimes is not, it must
be hallucinatory. Because he considered psi abilities to be unproven
(Augustine, 2015a), this conclusion is unavoidable for him, yet the distortions he cataloged (Augustine, 2007b, 2015b) looked exactly like
what researchers have observed with psi (Price, 1995). Distortions of
the same kind are even more pronounced in remote viewing, ganzfeld mentation, and experiments with dream telepathy, procedures
designed to circumvent the brain’s consciousness filters (Baptista, Derakhshani, & Tressoldi, 2015). Subconscious processing also allows
cultural and individual ideas and expectations to influence material
presented to conscious awareness. This point, I think, explains variations in NDE and IE phenomenology, in particular why nonhuman
beings in similar roles are perceived in dissimilar, but culturally appropriate, ways, by different experiencers.
The model I am sketching supposes an objective reality to discarnate existence beyond the subjective mental states of the experiencer.
Spirits of deceased humans and nonhuman entities alike are assumed
to be streams of consciousness that perceive and communicate with
each other via psi. Their actions are real and have real consequences
for the experiencer, but they are played out on an imaginary terrain
that is conditioned by an individual’s beliefs and expectations carried
into death. If I am right about this, there will be variations in social
practices in discarnate existence, just as there are in embodied life,
and absolute uniformity in any aspect of NDEs or IEs should not be
expected.
My model shares with McClenon’s (2002, 2006a, 2006b) ritual
healing theory a willingness to take subjective experience seriously
and a recognition that interpretation of these experiences in strictly
materialist terms is untenable. However, whereas McClenon argued
that anomalous experiences, including NDEs, have a practical benefit to those who experience them and that the capacity to have these
experiences was selected for during physical evolution, I use NDEs
to explore the nature of discarnate existence. I do this by grouping
NDEs with IEs, which occurred after death was final and the brain
was completely inoperative. IEs can be explained in naturalistic terms
only with the (baseless) assumption that they are not memories but
are hallucinations imagined to be memories, experienced by young
children who, in many cases, also have veridical memories of previous
lives. I do not mean to assert that physiology has nothing to do with

NDEs, which, unlike IEs, involve a return to the same body in the
end, but physiology cannot tell the whole story. Sorting out the relative
contributions of physiology, cultural influence, subconscious processing, and the objective reality of discarnate existence in NDEs will
take time, but I hope I have shown that there are reasons to accept at
least some NDEs as actual glimpses into the beyond.
