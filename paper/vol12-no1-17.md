# Reincarnation Beliefs Among Near Death Experiencers

### Amber D. Wells

_University_ _of_ _Connecticut_

_ABSTRACT:_ **Several** **researchers** have found **that** near-death **experiences**
**(NDEs)** **tend** **to** **increase** **belief** **in reincarnation.** This **study** **was** **designed** **to**
**examine** **the** **factors** **underlying** **this** **belief** **shift.** **I** **used** **a** **questionnaire** **to**
**compare** **the** **tendency toward** **belief** **in** **reincarnation** **among NDErs,** individ
**uals** **merely** **interested** **in** **NDEs,** **and** **a** **non-experiencer,** **non-interest** **control**
**group.** **In** **addition,** **I** **interviewed** 14 NDErs **to** **gain** **insight** **into** **the** **factors**
**influencing NDErs'** **beliefs.** **NDErs'** **reincarnation** **belief shift** **appeared** **to** **be**
**due** **to** **(a)** **direct** **knowledge** **of** **reincarnation** **gained** **by some** **NDErs** **in** **the** **NDE**
**itself;** **(b)** **knowledge** **of** **reincarnation** **gained through** **a** **general** **psychic awak**
**ening** **following** the NDE; **or** **(c)** **exploration** **of** **alternative** **perceptions** of reality
**following** **the** **NDE.**

**Previous** **research has indicated** that **following a** near-death **experi**
**ence (NDE),** **experiencers** **tend** to exhibit **a** **significant** shift in their
**beliefs** **on** **a** **wide** **range** **of** **subjects,** **including** **an** **increased** **acceptance** **of**
**others,** **a** **significantly** **greater** **belief in** **life** **after** death, **and** **a** **decreased**
**emphasis** **on** **material** **success** (Atwater, **1988;** Flynn, **1986;** Grey, 1985;
**Morse** and Perry, **1992;** **Ring,** 1984, **1992;** **Sutherland,** **1992).** These
belief **changes** **have** **also** **included** **a** **general** **tendency toward an** **in**
**creased** **openness** to the **idea** **of** **reincarnation** (Gallup and Proctor,
**1982; Ring,** **1980,** **1984, 1992;** **Sutherland,** **1992).**
It is this belief shift that **was** **the** **focus** of the present study. The
**question** of what **precipitates** the shift **toward** **belief** **in** **reincarnation**
has not yet **been** **systematically** **addressed** in the **literature.** In this

Amber **D.** **Wells** **was** **a** **student** at the University **of** **Connecticut** **at** **the** **time** **of** **this** **study.**
This **paper** **is** **based** **on** **her** **senior** **honors** **thesis** **under** **the** **direction** **of** **Kenneth** **Ring,**
**Ph.D.** **Reprint** **requests** **should** **be** **addressed** **to** **Ms.** **Wells** **at** **2950** **Bixby** **Lane,** Apt. A213,

**study,** **I** **attempted** **to** **answer** **this** **question** **and,** **additionally,** **to** **deter**
**mine** **if** **a** **consistent picture** **of** **the** **purpose** **and** **process** **of** **reincarnation**
**would** **emerge** **from** **the** **accounts** **of** **near-death** **experiencers.**
**Previous** **researchers** **such** **as** **Kenneth** **Ring** **have** **suggested** **that**
**near-death** **experiencers'** **increased** **openness** **toward** **the** **idea** **of** **reincar**
**nation** **may** **be** **less** **a** **factor** **of** **the** **NDE** **itself** **than** **a** **result** **of** **life**
**changes** **following** **the** **experience:**

**Of** **course,** **there** **is** **no** **reason** **why** **an** **NDEr's** **openness toward** **reincar**
**nation** **must** **stem directly** **from** **his** **NDE. In** **fact,** **I** **am** **quite** **convinced**
**that** **in** **many** **cases** **it** **is** **more** **likely** **to** **be** **a** **response** **to** **an** **NDEr's**
**reading** **and other** **life** **experiences** **following** **an** **NDE.** **(Ring,** **1984,** **p.**
**160)**


**Ring's** **study** **also** **suggested** **that** **belief** **in** **or** **openness** **to** **reincarnation**
**among** **NDErs** **was often** **accompanied** **by** **a** **more** **general** **endorsement**
**of** **Eastern** **religions.** **This** **has** **also** **been noted** **in** **the** **work** **of** **Cherie**
**Sutherland** **(1992).** **Other researchers** **(Twemlow,** **Gabbard,** **and** **Jones,**
**1982) found** **a** **similar** **shift** **in religious** **beliefs** **among** **individuals** **hav**
**ing** **not** **near-death** **experiences** **but** out-of-body **experiences.** **Thus it** **is**
**possible** **that** **the** **NDE** **is** **simply** **one** **of** **many** **catalysts** **for** **an** **increased**
**openness** **to** **reincarnation.** **In** **fact,** **it** **has** **been** **suggested** **that** **simply** **an**
**interest** **in** **near-death** **phenomena** **can serve** **as** **a** **catalyst** **for** **many** **of**
**the** **value changes** **expressed** **by** **NDErs,** **including an increased** **open**
**ness** **to** **the** **idea** **of** **reincarnation** **(K.** **Ring,** **personal** **communication,**
**1991).**


**If** **it** **is** **true** **that** **the** **NDE** **influences** **individuals'** **reincarnation** **be**
**liefs simply** **by** **causing** **them** **to** **consider** **new** **religions** **or** **spiritual**
**ideas,** **then** **one** **would expect** **that** **individuals** **who** **exhibited** **an** **interest**
**in** **the** **NDE** **would also** **be** **prompted** **to** **undergo** **a** **similar** **belief** **shift.** **If,**
**on** **the** **other** **hand,** **it** **is** **something** **inherent** **in** **the** **NDE** **itself** **that** **leads**
**individuals** **to** **consider** **the** **possibility** **of** **reincarnation,** **then** **one** **would**
**expect** **that** **individuals** **who** **were** **merely** **interested** **in** **such** **phenomena**
**but** **who** **had** **not** **experienced** **it** **themselves** **would** **have** **reincarnation**
**beliefs** **that** **differed** **significantly** **from** **those** **of** **near-death** **experiencers**
**and** **would** **instead** **be** **similar** **to** **those** **of** **individuals** **who** **have** **no** **such**
**interest** **in** **NDEs.**


**In** **this** **study,** **questionnaires** **were** **used** **to** **determine the** **reincarna**
**tion** **beliefs** **of** **a** **group** **of** **NDErs,** **a** **group** **of** **subjects** **who** **were** **interested**
**in** **near-death** **experiences** **but** **had** **not** **had an** **NDE,** **and** **also** **a** **group** **of**
**subjects** **who** **were** **chosen** **to** **represent** **the** **general** **non-experiencer,**

**non-interest** **population.** **Interviews** **of** **NDErs** **were** **also** **conducted** **to**
**gain** **a deeper** **insight** **into** **the** **origins and** **structure** **of** **their** **beliefs**
**concerning** **reincarnation.**

**Method**

**_Subjects_**

**There** **were** **four** **separate** **subject groups** **employed** **in** **this** **study.** **The**
**first** **group,** **the** **near-death** **experiencer** **interview** **group** **(or** **NDEI**
**group)** **consisted** **of** **14** **near-death** **experiencers** **currently residing** **in** **the**
**state** **of** **Connecticut** **who** **were** **selected** **from** **among** **Ring's** **files** **and**
**from** **individuals** **who** **attended** **Friends** **of** **LANDS** **(International** **Asso**
**ciation** **for** **Near-Death** **Studies)** **meetings** **that** **convene** **monthly in**
**Farmington,** **Connecticut.** **The** **second** **group,** **the** **near-death** **experi**
**encer** **(NDE)** **group,** **consisted** **of** **43** **near-death** **experiencers** **from** **var**
**ious** **locations** **throughout** **the United** **States** **who** **responded** **to** **a** **mailed**
**questionnaire** **regarding** **their** **beliefs** **about** **reincarnation.** **These** **indi**
**viduals** **were** **also** **selected** **from** **among** **Ring's** **files.** **The** **third** **group** **was**
**composed** **of** **34** **individuals** **who** **have** **not** **had** **a** **near-death** **experience,**
**but** **who** **indicated** **an** **interest** **in** **the** **near-death** **phenomenon** **through**
**correspondence** **with** **Ring** **at** **the** **University** **of** **Connecticut.** **This** **group**
**also** **responded** **to** **the** **mailed** **reincarnation** **beliefs** **questionnaire** **and**
**will** **be** **referred** **to** **as** **the** **interest** **group.** **The** **fourth and** **final** **group**
**consisted** **of** **30** **individuals** **who** **were** **approached outside** **a** **grocery**
**store** **in** **Willimantic,** **Connecticut,** **and** **who** **agreed** **to** **fill** **out** **the rein**
**carnation** **beliefs** **questionnaire.** **This** **group** **will** **be** **referred** **to as** **the**
**control** **group.**

**_Materials_**

**A** **questionnaire** **consisting** **of** **16** **statements** **about** **reincarnation** **was**
**developed** **specifically** **for** **this** **study** **to** **evaluate** **respondents'** **degree** **of**
**belief** **in** **reincarnation.** **The** **questionnaires** **were** **mailed** **with** **a** **cover**
**letter** **explaining the** **nature** **of** **the** **study and** **requesting** **the** **individ**
**ual's** **participation** **was** **included.** **The** **interview** **schedule** **used** **with** **the**
**NDEI** **group** **consisted** **of** **questions** **referring** **to** **NDErs'** **beliefs** **about**
**reincarnation** **and** **the** **factors** **that** **shaped** **their** **beliefs** **(see** **Appendix).**
**A** **tape** **recorder** **and cassette** **tapes** **were** **used** **to** **tape** **the** **interviews.**


-----

**Three** **of** **the** **interviews** **were** **not** **tape** **recorded** **because** **the** **situation,**
**usually** **too** **much** **background** **noise,** **prevented** **it.** **These** **interviews**
**were recorded** **using** **paper and** **pen.**

**_Procedure_**


**Fifty questionnaires** **were** **mailed** **to** **the** **near-death** **experiencer**
**group,** **of** **which 29** **were** **returned;** **while** **50** **questionnaires** **were** **mailed**
**to** **the** **near-death** **interest** **group,** **of** **which** **34** **were** **returned.**
**In** **addition,** **30** **individuals** **who** **were** **approached outside** **a** **grocery**
**store** **in** **Willimantic,** **Connecticut,** **agreed** **to** **respond** **to** **the** **reincarna**
**tion** **beliefs** **questionnaire.** **These subjects** **were told** **that** **I** **was** **a** **student**
**at** **the** **University** **of** **Connecticut** **conducting** **my** **honors'** **thesis** **on** **the**
**subject** **of** **reincarnation,** **and** **were** **asked** **to** **fill** **out** **a** **questionnaire**
**regarding** **their** **reincarnation** **beliefs.**
**The** **questionnaire** **consisted** **of** **eight** **statements** **favorable** **to** **the** **idea**
**of** **reincarnation** **and** **eight statements** **unfavorable** **to** **it, and** **was** **de**
**signed** **using** **a** **Likert** **format. The** **subjects** **were** **asked** **to respond** **to**
**each** **statement** **with** **a** +2 **to** **indicate** **strong** **agreement** **with** **the**
**statement,** **a** **+1** **to** **indicate** **a** **tendency toward** **agreement,** **a** **0** **to**
**indicate** **no** **opinion,** **a** **-1** **to** **indicate** **a** **tendency toward** **disagreement,**
**and** **a** -2 **to** **indicate** **strong** **disagreement.**
**Finally,** **14** **near-death** **experiencers** **from** **the** **NDEI** **group** **were** **con**
**tacted** **by** **phone** **and** **interviews** **were** **arranged.** **In** **the** **course** **of** **each**
**interview,** **the** **subject** **was** **asked** **to** **fill** **out** **the** **reincarnation** **beliefs**
**questionnaire.** **Because** **the** **NDEI** **group's** **mean** **reincarnation** **beliefs**
**score** **did** **not** **differ** **significantly** **from** **that** **of** **the** **NDEr** **questionnaire**
**only** **group** (t= **1.62,** **df=** **13;** **p** **<0.2),** **these** **two** **groups** **were combined** **for**
**the** **purpose** **of** **questionnaire** **analysis, and** **are** **referred** **to as** **the** **NDEr**
**group.**

**Each** **subject** **was** **then** **assigned** **a** **reincarnation** **belief** **score** **from** **-32**
**to** **+32** **by** **subtracting** **the** **sum** **of** **their** **responses** **against reincarnation**
**from** **the** **sum** **of** **their** **responses** **that** **were** **pro-reincarnation.** **A** **score** **of**
**+32 meant** **that** **the** **subject** **had** **responded** **with** **a** **+2** **to** **all** **of** **the**
**statements** **considered favorable** **toward** **the** **idea** **of** **reincarnation** **and**
**with** **a** -2 **to** **all** **of** **the** **statements** **considered** **unfavorable** **to** **the** **idea**
**and** **thus** **constitutes** **a** **perfect** **pro-reincarnation** **score.** **A** **-32** **consti**
**tutes** **a** **perfect** **score** **in** **the** **other** **direction.** **A** **constant** **of** **+32** **was** **then**

_Analysis_


**21**


A one-way analysis of variance including Scheffe's post-hoc test was
performed on the questionnaire data in addition to a chi-squared test.
The interviews were analyzed to answer these questions: How do near
death experiencers feel about reincarnation? Were there any common
alities among their beliefs? Have their beliefs changed since their
experience? And if so, what factors led to these changes-was it the
experience itself or life changes that took place following the experi
ence? The last two questions of the interview directly addressed this
**issue.**

**Results**

_Questionnaire_ _Data_


The mean reincarnation belief score for the NDErs was 46.19; for the
NDE interest group the mean was 46.94; and for the non-interest
control the mean was 33.09.

An analysis of variance revealed that there was a significant differ
ence among the reincarnation belief scores of the three groups **(F=9.79;**
df=2, 109; p <..01). Further statistical analysis with Scheffe's post-hoc
test indicated that no significant difference existed between the rein
carnation belief **scores** of the NDErs and the NDE interest group
**(F=0.03;** df=2, 109). However, a significant difference was found be
tween the scores of the non-interest control group and both the near
death experience and the near-death interest groups **(F=7.60;** df=2,
109; **p<.01** and **F=7.67;** df=2, 109; **p<.01** respectively).
The range of possible **scores** from 0 to 64 was divided into thirds, with
scores from 0 to 21 representing strong belief that reincarnation does
not occur, scores from 22 to 42 representing neutral beliefs, and scores
from 43 to 64 representing strong belief in reincarnation. Table 1
shows a breakdown of scores of the three study groups into these three
categories. Seventy percent of these NDErs and 71 percent of the NDE
interest group indicated a strong belief in reincarnation, while only 30
percent of the control group did so.
A chi-squared test of these data revealed that the reincarnation
belief scores for the NDE group and the NDE interest group were
significantly more positive than that of the non-interest control group,
whose scores tended to fall in the neutral region (chi-squared=78.15;

df=4; p <.005). Percentages of subjects in each group who expressed
agreement with each statement are listed in Table 2.

_Interview_ _Data_

_NDErs'_ _Belief_ _in Reincarnation._ A review of my interview data
revealed that 13 of the 14 NDErs either believed in reincarnation or
were at least open to the idea. Seven of the NDErs I interviewed did not
believe in reincarnation before their experience, but did believe in it
afterwards. Four individuals did not believe in reincarnation before
their NDE or afterwards. However, although these respondents did not
definitely believe in reincarnation, they were at least open to the
possibility. Two individuals had considered reincarnation prior to their
NDE, but the experience led them to change the way they looked at it;
one subject now believed in reincarnation on more of a collective level
rather than as an individual process, and the other came to think about
**reincarnation** **more** **seriously** **and** **consider** **it** **more** **in** **depth** **following**
his experience. One subject did not believe in reincarnation before her
NDE, and the experience had no effect on her views.
No strong common pattern of beliefs about the process or purpose of
reincarnation surfaced in my interviews. However, a few common
alities were seen in some of the respondents' answers. No one claimed

to have gained any direct understanding of the nature or process of
reincarnation during his or her NDE. Three of the 14 respondents,
**however,** **claimed** **a** **"sense"** **or** **"perception"** **during** **their** **experience** **of**
having lived before. Only one respondent claimed to have had a past
lives review, in which she re-experienced events from a past life, during
an NDE.


_The_ _Nature_ _of_ _Reincarnation._ In response to the question about the
general process of reincarnation, four respondents mentioned one con
**sciousness** **separating** **into** **individual** **souls** **to** **be** **embodied** **in** **matter.**
One respondent took this idea further, to state that reincarnation takes
place more on a collective rather than an individual level. In other
words, she felt that a collective energy recycles itself through matter
and that our sense of individuality is a product of our present incarna
tion only. One respondent believed that a higher power created a finite
number of individual **souls,** some of which then are placed in human
embodiments in order to learn **lessons.**
A strong minority of respondents, six of 14, saw individual choice as
the initiating force behind the reincarnation process. Three other indi
viduals mentioned karmic patterns or ties to other souls as influencing
the reincarnation process.

Eight of 14 subjects mentioned learning or enlightenment as the
main purpose underlying reincarnation. One respondent said, "The
spirit needs to embody itself in matter to experience it and learn. There
are karmic patterns to learn lessons and to work spirit in matter."
Another commented, "Life itself is a series of leanings. The lessons are
universal, the two most important being truth and forgiveness."
Ten of 14 interviewees believed it is possible to remember past lives,
**while** **two** **remained** **unsure** **and** **one** **saw** **claims** **of** **past** **life** **re**
**membrances** **as most** likely the result of fantasy.
Eleven of 14 subjects believed in the concept of karma or at least were
**open** to it. Five of the 11, however, qualified their affirmation with
further explanation of their beliefs:

Yes, but not in that sense. We progress at our own rate to reach the
light. If you do things that take you away from the light, then you are
perpetuating your time here.

[I] don't believe in karma as some people do-that it is pre-destiny. We
have karma but we can change it.

**Karma** **is** **misunderstood;** **it's** **not** **just** **negative.** **Everything** **is** **karma,**
**even** **thoughts.**

**Consequences** **carry** **over** **to** **some** **degree,** **but the** **emphasis** **is** **not** **so**
**much** **on** **the** **physical** **act,** **but** **more** **on** **what** **is going** **on** **inside.**

**Definitely,** **but** **there** **are** **no** **rights** **or** wrongs-it **just** **is. We** **all have**
**light** **and** **dark** **and** **we** **need** **to** **balance** **them** **out.**

**When** **asked** **what** **goes** **on** **during** **the** **period between** **incarnations,**
**seven subjects** **mentioned** **learning** **as** **the** **main** **activity** **of** **the** **soul.**
**Four** **mentioned** **resting,** **rejuvenation,** **and/or** **connecting** **with** **God,** **and**
**one** **subject** **indicated** **that** **individuals** **are** **involved** **in** **setting** **up** **the**
**circumstances** **of** **their** **next** **life** **during** **this** **time.** **When asked** **if** **one's**
**personal awareness** **and** **sense** **of** **personal** **identity** **remained** **intact** **in**
**the** **afterlife** **realm** **and** **for** **how** **long,** **two** **subjects** **answered** **affir**
**matively,** **one** **believing** **that** **the personality** **would** **continue** **forever**
**and the** **other** **unsure** **as** **to** **how** **long** **this** **sense** **of** **"self'** **would** **remain.**
**The** **majority** **of** **respondents,** **however,** **eight** **out** **of** **14,** **gave more**
**qualified** **endorsements** **of** **this** **proposition.** **Here are** **three** **examples** **of**
**their** **responses:**

**would** **continue** **to** **incarnate** **into other** **realms** **or** **dimensions.**

_Factors_ _Underlying_ _the_ _Shift_ _Toward_ _Belief_ _in_ _Reincarnation._ _A_


more definite pattern emerged in the subjects' responses to the ques
tion about which factors led to the change in their reincarnation
beliefs. Three causes for changes in beliefs in a direction favorable to
reincarnation were mentioned.


One cause for this belief shift, for which I found only limited evidence
in this study, is direct knowledge imparted during the NDE itself.
Three of my 14 interview subjects claimed to have a "sense" that they
had lived before during their NDE. For two of my subjects this factor
would qualify as the main event influencing their reincarnation be
liefs. One subject, however, had several NDEs and also exhibited a
significant psychic awakening, involving direct information concern
ing reincarnation, following her experiences. She claimed to have had a
past-lives review during one NDE, but did not indicate which one.
Therefore, I do not know which came first: the direct reincarnation
knowledge through her psychic awakening, or the past-lives review.
Thus, I do not know for certain which was the influencing factor in her
belief shift. However, because her post-NDE experiences were so many,
so extensive, and obviously so influential in her beliefs, it is more likely
these experiences, rather than her NDE past-lives review, that shaped
her beliefs, and she is consequently categorized as such.
The second cause for the reincarnation shift was found in events
taking place after the NDErs' experience that seemed to be part of a
general psychic awakening. This general psychic awakening has been
documented by other researchers as well (Greyson, 1983; Ring, 1985).
Ring presented this idea as his "spiritual catalyst" hypothesis, which
implies that NDEs tend to lead to psychic development. For five of the
14 subjects in this study it was this psychic awakening following their
NDE, rather than the experience itself, that provided them with direct
knowledge of reincarnation. One subject explained:


Before any of these events, **I** **call** **mine** kind of a two-part event,
because I had the NDE in 1979, and then another car accident in 1985
that brought about what I call a kundalini awakening, which is
similar to an NDE without the death part of the physical body. So,
what happened to me is, before either of these experiences happened I
didn't believe in reincarnation at all.... After these experiences what
**one** **of** **the** **things** **that** **happened** **to** **me** **was** **I** **started getting** **memories**

of my own past lives. A lot of times just spontaneously something
would trigger it and I'd get this memory, and I see visions, and then I
started getting them of other people's **lives.**

Two other **experiencers** **noted** **similar** **phenomena:**


-----

**This didn't** **come** **about** **from** **the** **experience** **but** **afterwards,** **since** **then.**

**[I've** **received]** **messages,** **my** **brother-in-law** **[deceased]** **had** **a** **mes**
sage ... that his soul would be reincarnated into my sister's son.


I had **ongoing** **experiences** after the near-death **experience.** In that
**after** **process** **I** **experienced** **souls.** **On** **one** **occasion** **it's** **like** **I** **followed a**

soul, went through a process with a soul, in how they were reborn, how
it came about that they were reborn.

Finally, as the third source of the reincarnation belief shift, the NDE
opened the individual up to greater possibilities in his or her percep
tion of reality. It made them more willing to explore a wider range of
**spiritual** **possibilities,** **including** **reincarnation.** This **exploration** **was**
manifest in the form of reading, discussions with others, and personal
reflection. Six of my 14 subjects fell into this category. One respondent
said of her NDE: "It opened up a dimension that I never really knew
existed." Another commented: "It [his NDE] didn't help me conclude
anything, it just threw the doors of possibility wide open." Still another
**said:**

I didn't even know what reincarnation was before I had an NDE. It
was afterwards that I was led to find out what it was. Some of the
things I'm telling you [about reincarnation] came out in other conver
**sations** **and** **some** **in** **the reading** that **I've** **done,** **and** **some** **just** thoughts
I've had. And it made total sense to me.

And finally one woman I interviewed said:

[I] hadn't given it [reincarnation] much thought before that [her NDE].
I was brought up in a fairly conventional religion-Catholicism. I was
not a particularly practicing Catholic at the time, but more or less
hadn't explored much Eastern philosophy. After the experience, I did. I
read a great deal of different philosophies, not just Eastern, but all of
them, and found that it [reincarnation] was plausible.

**Discussion**

In this study, 70 percent of the sample of NDErs demonstrated belief
in reincarnation. In contrast, a Gallup Poll (Gallup and Proctor, 1982)
found that only 23 percent of the general population endorse this belief,
while 30 percent of my control group help views favorable to reincarna
tion. These data confirm the findings of earlier studies with respect to

**In** **each** **incarnation** **we** **have** **a** **different** **physical** body, **a** **different**
**name,** **and** **may have** **different** **souls** **acting** **as** **parents,** **but these**

**tion** **belief** **shift,** **I** **can** **offer** **three** **possibilities** **suggested** by my **data,** **but**

**views.** Although I **did** **not** **find** **extensive** **evidence** **for** **this** **in** **my** **study,**
**it** **has** **been documented** **by** **other** **researchers** **(Morse** **and** **Perry,** **1992;**
**Ring,** **1985).** **In those** **cases,** **individuals** **claimed** **to** **have** **received** **direct**

knowledge of reincarnation during the NDE itself. An example of this
type of knowledge can be seen in a letter written to Ring by John
Robinson:

It is a matter of personal knowledge from what the Being with whom I
spoke during my NDE told me about my older son, that he had had 14
incarnations in female physical bodies previous to the life he has just
had.

Ring has also heard testimony of this kind of direct knowledge in some
of his interviews. One NDEr, whose account is recorded in Ring's
audiotape archives, commented:

My whole life went before me of things I have done and haven't done,
but not just of this one lifetime, but of all the lifetimes. I know for a fact
there is reincarnation. This is an absolute. I was shown all those lives
and how I had overcome some of the things I had done in other lives.
There was still some things to be corrected.

Another NDEr whose testimony is included in Ring's audiotape ar
chives gave this account:

I had a lot of questions, and I wanted to know what they [light beings
she encountered in her NDE] were doing-why are you just kind of
milling around here? And someone stepped forward ... it wasn't just
one ... I got information from a number of them ... that they were all
**waiting** **for** **reincarnation.**


Additionally, in a case documented by Melvin Morse, a girl who had
her NDE when she nearly drowned at the age of 7 reported seeing
during her experience two adults waiting to be reborn (Morse, 1983).
Second, some NDErs may gain direct knowledge of reincarnation
through other psychic or mystical **experiences** following their NDE. In
this way, the NDE becomes a catalyst for openness to reincarnation
through its ability to propel the experiencer into a general psychic
**awakening.**

Finally, for other NDErs their experience serves mainly to spark
their interest in various "New Age" phenomena that leads to often
**extensive outside** **reading** **and** **research.** **It** **makes** **sense** **that** **when** **one**
becomes open to the idea of life after death, the idea of life after life
becomes much more plausible.

**The** **fact** **that** **my** **NDE** **interest** **group** **exhibited** **reincarnation** **belief**
**scores** **so** **similar** **to** **those** **of** **my** **NDE** **sample can** **be** **explained** **by** **two**
**hypotheses.** **First,** **it** **is** **possible** **that** **some** **of** **my** **NDE** **interest** **subjects**
**may have** **gained direct** **knowledge** **of** **reincarnation** **through** **other**

**through** **unspecified means, and** **thus** **were led** **to** **explore** **the** **concept** **of**

**the** **factors** **influencing** **the** **beliefs** **of** **the** **subjects** **in** **the** **NDE** **interest**

**is** **about** **an** **interest** **in** **near-death** **experiences** **that** **promotes** **an** **open**
**ness** **to** **reincarnation,** **or** **if** **in** **fact** **both** **the** **interest** **in** **NDEs** **and**

**_physical_** **_body._**

**First,** **however,** **I'd** **like** **to** **ask** **you** **whether** **your** **own** **near-death**
**experience** **gave** **you** **any** **insights** **into** **this** **matter** **of** **reincarnation.** **Did**
**anything** **in** **your** **NDE** **itself** **touch** **on** **this** **question,** **and** **if** **so,** **what**
**exactly** **was** **it?** **[Pause** **for** **answer]**

**Some people** **say** **that** **during** **their** **NDE** they **had** **a** **"life** **review" in**
**which** **various events** **of** **their** **life** **are** **seen** **again,** **usually** **in** **a very** **vivid**
**way.** **A** **few** **people,** **however,** **say** **that** **they** **seem** **to** **see** **events** **from** **their**
**"past** **lives"** **as** **well.** **Did** **this** **kind** **of** **"past** **lives"** **review** **happen** **to** **you**
**during** **your** **NDE?** **[If yes,** **as** **respondent** **to** **elaborate]**

**Sometimes** **people** **say** **that** **during** **their** **NDE** **they** **were** **given** **a** **kind**
**of** **direct** **understanding** **of** **the** **general** **process** **of** **reincarnation.** **Did**

respondent to clarify his/her status. If respondent is not a believer in
reincarnation or hasn't thought about it, give him/her the Reincarna
tion Questionnaire to fill out. In that **case,** simply wait for that to be
done before concluding the interview by asking respondent the last set
of questions concerning changes in his/her views about reincarnation
**since** his/her NDE]

[Interview continues thus for respondents who are open to or believe
in reincarnation]


My first question is a very general one: (1) In your view, what is the
process of reincarnation? In short, how does it work? [For this and all
questions that follow in this series, allow plenty of time for respondent
to elaborate, and encourage further elaboration if necessary]


(2) What initiates the process that leads the individual to reincarnate
into another body?


(3) Does the individual have a choice about whether to reincarnate? If
so, what factors affect that choice? Does anyone outside the individual
guide the individual here?


(4) Why does a person reincarnate? That is, is there a general purpose
that underlies reincarnation? Or does it differ from individual to
individual?


(5) In your view, does an individual about to reincarnate choose his/
her parents, the general circumstances of his/her life, etc., or is that
determined by factors outside the person's own control?


(6) When does the person's soul enter the body? Does this vary?
(7) Once "in", can the soul occasionally "go out" again at or around the
time of birth?


(8) Some people claim to be able to remember past lives. Do you think
this is possible?


(9) Do you believe in the concept of karma-the idea that whatever we
do has consequences, and that these consequences can carry over from
one life to another? [If yes, then:] How does this tie in for you with the
concept of reincarnation?


(10) When you die, what in general terms do you think happens
afterward?


(11) If there is a period between lives, what goes on during that
interval?


(12) Do you think that there is any kind of a "life review and assess
ment" during this interval? [If so, then:] How is it related, if at all, to
one's eventual next life?


-----

(13) Does the individual's **personal** awareness and sense of personal
identity remain intact in the afterlife **realm?** For how long?


(14) What happens to that personality after the individual begins the
process of reincarnation? Does it in **some** sense continue to exist or does
it simply cease **as** **an** independent entity?


(15) Does the cycle of reincarnation for a given individual ever come
to an end? [If yes, then:] What brings it to an end? What happens to the
individual then?


Thank you for taking the time to answer all these questions of mine.
Before we conclude this interview, though, I have just a few more
things to ask you about reincarnation.

The first is very straightforward and won't take you long. I have a
brief questionnaire that I'd like you to fill out for me now. It simply lists
a series of statements about reincarnation and asks you merely to
indicate whether you agree or disagree with these statements. It will
just take a few more minutes of your time. [Give respondent question
naire, and wait for him/her to finish]

My last set of questions- and there are just a few of them-have to do
with some of the factors that may have shaped your beliefs about
reincarnation. [These questions are to be asked of both the believers in
reincarnation and those who indicated at the beginning of the inter
view that they did not believe in reincarnation or hadn't thought about
it]

First, have your views about reincarnation changed since your NDE?

[If yes, then:] How so, and what brought about these changes? Do you
think it was the experience itself or was it the result of life changes
after the experience? For example, new religions you may have ex
plored, groups you've joined, workshops you've taken, books you've
read, etc.? [Have respondent elaborate freely, and follow up to clarify
the sources which have influenced the respondent's beliefs and under
standing about reincarnation]

Well, that concludes my interview, [respondent's **name].** Thank you so
much again for taking the time to answer my questions so
thoughtfully. Now, can I answer any questions for you about my pro
ject? [Engage the respondent as much as he/she would care to concern
ing the research, what has been learned so far, etc.]
