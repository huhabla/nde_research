SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a highly skilled Near Death Experience (NDE) researcher with vast knowledge of NDE reports. You will analyse 
new reports and put them intelligently in a JSON structure for further research.
"""

USER_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with extracting specific information from a near-death experience (NDE) report. Your goal is to analyze 
the report carefully and extract relevant details to fill a structured JSON output. This output will follow a specific 
format based on a Pydantic BaseModel.

Here is the NDE report you will be analyzing:

<nde_report>
{nde_report}
</nde_report>

You must extract information from this report and format it into a JSON structure that matches the following Pydantic BaseModel:

```python
{base_model}
```

Follow these instructions to extract and format the information:

1. Read the entire NDE report carefully, including any question/answer sections if present.

2. For each field in the NdeReport model:
   a. Extract relevant information from the report.
   b. Ensure the extracted information matches the field's description and type.
   c. If information is uncertain or missing, use appropriate default values or indicate uncertainty.

3. Pay special attention to the following fields:
   - summary: Provide a concise summary of all important events in the NDE.
   - conversations: Include any significant dialogues between the experiencer and spiritual entities.
   - spirit_leaders: List only names of spiritual leaders the experiencer was certain about meeting.
   - state_of_consciousness: Determine if it was normal, higher, lower, or unknown.
   - reinkarnation: Include any mentions of past lives or discussions about reincarnation.
   - experience_type: Classify as positive, negative, neutral, or unknown.
   - assessment: Provide your analysis of the NDE, highlighting important aspects like tunnels, beings, or realms encountered.
   - experienced_god and experienced_jesus: Set to True only if explicitly mentioned in the report.

4. If certain information is not present in the report, use these guidelines:
   - For string fields, use an empty string "" or "unknown" as appropriate.
   - For the list field (spirit_leaders), use an empty list [].
   - For boolean fields, use False if not explicitly mentioned.

5. Format your final output as a valid JSON object, ensuring all field names match the Pydantic model exactly.

Present your final output within <json_output> tags. Ensure the JSON is properly formatted and valid.
